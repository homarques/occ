% INPUT
%   A        - Datafile
%   FEATSIZE - Desired feature size, 
%              Default: compute from first object in A

% OUTPUT
%   A       - Datafile
%
% DESCRIPTION
% If A is a dataset, its featsize is set. The featsize of a datafile
% is unclear as objects may have different sizes. For that reason
% the feature sizes of datafiles might better be set to 0, unless the
% objects are images of the same size.
