%TIMES Mapping overload
%
% If W is a mapping then V=W.*X and V=X.*W define a new mapping V
% such that all output dimensions A*W are multiplied (scaled) by
% the corresponding elements of X. The length of the vector X
% should be equal to the output dimension of W. If X is a scalar
% it is applied to all output dimensions.
