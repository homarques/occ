 %STAMP_MAP Stamping and storing of mappings for fast reusage
%
%		C = STAMP_MAP(A,W) or C = A*W
%		U = STAMP_MAP(V,W) or U = V*W
%
% This routine is equivalent to MAP except that it stores previous
% results (C or U) and retrieves them when the same inputs (A and W
% or V and W) are given. This is especially good in case of combining
% classifier studies when the same mappings have to be computed multiple
% times.
%
% Note that only the highest level of calls to MAP are stored by STAMP_MAP.
% If multiple calls to lower level calls (e.g. somewhere included in a
% complicated combined classifier) are expected, they should be called
% first explicitely.
% 
% STAMP_MAP is automatically called inside MAP (and thereby by every
% overloaded * operation between datasets and mappings) controlled by
% the following settings:
%
% STAMP_MAP(0)  - disables all storage and retrieval of mappings.
%                 This should be called when no duplicates are expected
%                 as it prevents the unnecessary checking of inputs.
% STAMP_MAP(1)  - Retrieving of stored results only only.
%                 No new results are stored.
% STAMP_MAP(2)  - Enables retrieval as well as storage of results.
