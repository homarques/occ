% INPUT
%   A        Dataset
%   CLNR     Class number

%
% OUTPUT
%   B        One-class dataset

%
% DESCRIPTION
% Change a normal dataset A into an one-class dataset: the class
% indicated by the classnr (CLNR) is made target class and all other
% data becomes outliers class. The labels are changed to 'target' and
% 'outlier'.
%
% It is also possible to use a class label, but then the type of the
% label should be a char (else you cannot distinguish it from a class
% number, can you?:-))
%
% As a second output argument an index vector I is returned, indicating
% which objects are target (I=1) or outlier (I=2).

		% That is the case, we swap the classes. We just swap
		% the labels by changing nlab so we can later search for 'target'
		% instead of 'outlier':

			% Now we check if we are not dealing with strange situations
			% that all data is of one of the classes:
			if getsize(a,3)==2
				% Ok, swap the labels
				a = set(a,'nlab',3-getnlab(a));

	% smaller than 32 (smaller ASCI value), than something went probabily
	% wrong, and then we assume it were just doubles. This happens for

			% to a number
			clnr = str2double(clnr);
			if ~isempty(clnr)

			%else the clnr was a label-string and not a number, so it will
			%not match anyway
			end
		else % Lablist is character
			% Ok, we get a bit inconsistent behaviour here. It might be
			% that when the dataset contains just target objects, the label
			% becomes 'target' without trailing ' '. Then the strmatch has
			% to be switched. When also outliers are present, there will be
			% always this trailing ' ', so then we don't have a problem.
			% (Thanks Piotr!:-)

	% Make the new labels, target objects get 1, outlier objects get 2:

		I = 2-(nlab==clnr);
		pr = getprior(a,0);

	% Now construct the dataset:

	a = set(a,'labels',labelnames(I,:));
